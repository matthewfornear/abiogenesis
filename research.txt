RESEARCH LOG – Abiogenesis Simulation Project
=============================================

Overview:
---------
This project explores the plausibility of prebiotic molecule formation from simple precursors, using ORCA quantum chemistry simulations to evaluate energetic favorability of potential reaction steps.

Simulation Methods:
-------------------
All calculations were run with Hartree-Fock (HF) using the 6-31G* basis set. Geometry optimizations were performed for individual molecules and clusters. No solvent models or catalysts were included at this stage.

Findings:
---------

1. 5 HCN Molecule Cluster (`hcn5/`)
   - FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY: -464.298729715253 Hartree
   - Molecules remained unreacted and linear after optimization.
   - Interpretation: stable baseline configuration for non-interacting HCN molecules.

2. Diaminomaleonitrile (`damn/`)
   - FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY: -294.814094291486 Hartree
   - Molecule geometry remained intact; all expected bonds held.
   - Interpretation: DAMN is geometrically viable, but not energetically favorable compared to isolated precursors.

3. 4 HCN Molecule Cluster (`4hcn/`)
   - FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY: -371.442347517426 Hartree
   - Molecules remained linear and unreacted.
   - Used for direct energy comparison with DAMN.

4. Aminomalononitrile (amn/)
FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY: -278.488728497469 Hartree

Molecule optimized successfully and retained expected geometry.

Interpretation: AMN is a stable intermediate candidate structurally.

5. 3 HCN + NH₃ Cluster (3hcn_nh3/)
FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY: -334.760245031167 Hartree

Molecules remained spatially distinct; no spontaneous bonding observed.

Reaction Energy Calculation:
Formation Reaction (simplified):
 3 HCN + NH₃ → AMN

ΔE = E_AMN - E_3HCN+NH3
ΔE = (-278.4887) - (-334.7602)
ΔE ≈ +56.27 Hartree ≈ +35,298 kcal/mol

Interpretation:
The formation of aminomalononitrile from 3 HCN and NH₃ is highly endothermic under HF/6-31G* in vacuum. This suggests the model lacks key stabilizing factors such as solvent effects or catalytic surfaces.

Planned Refinements:
Two new simulations have been prepared using DFT (B3LYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP) with implicit water solvation (CPCM model) to more accurately estimate the reaction thermodynamics:

amn_solvent_dft.inp: AMN in water
3hcn_nh3_solvent_dft.inp: Reactants in water

These runs aim to determine whether environmental context significantly alters the favorability of AMN formation.

6. Aminomalononitrile in water (`amn_solvent_dft/`)
   - FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY: -279.806055248158 Hartree
   - DFT optimization (B3LYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP) with CPCM(water)
   - Structure remained stable with minimal distortion from vacuum geometry.

7. 3 HCN + NH₃ Cluster in water (`3hcn_nh3_solvent_dft/`)
   - FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY: -336.378773570590 Hartree
   - All molecules retained original geometries; no spontaneous bonding occurred.

ΔE = E_AMN - E_3HCN+NH₃  
ΔE = (-279.8061) - (-336.3788)  
ΔE ≈ +56.57 Hartree ≈ +35,510 kcal/mol  

Conclusion:  
Even under solvation and DFT treatment, AMN formation from HCN + NH₃ is strongly endothermic. Prebiotic plausibility may depend on factors beyond basic thermodynamic favorability in isolation, such as stepwise synthesis, mineral surfaces, or energy input from the environment.
